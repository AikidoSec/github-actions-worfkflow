# Aikido Security Github action

This repository contains an application that can be used in Github action workflows. It will trigger a scan in Aikido to make sure no new critical issues are introduced into your application. This action is available in any paid plan at Aikido.

## Using the action

This is an example workflow you could use to trigger a scan for each new pull request

```yaml
name: My Github action
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '*'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Detect new vulnerabilities
        uses: AikidoSec/github-actions-workflow@v1.0.4
        with:
            secret-key: ${{ secrets.AIKIDO_SECRET_KEY }}
```

The action has 3 possible outcomes: 
- 'SUCCEEDED': the scan was completed successfully and we did not encounter any new critical issues
- 'FAILED': the scan was completed successfully, but we found new critical issues
- 'TIMED_OUT': the scan did not complete before the set timeout. In this case we won't let the action fail, but we do return this special case to not block your pipeline.

By default, the action fails if the scan did not complete within 2 minutes. You can control this behaviour by setting the `fail-on-timeout` parameter to false for the action, like so: 

```yaml
name: My Github action
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '*'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Detect new vulnerabilities
        uses: AikidoSec/github-actions-workflow@v1.0.4
        with:
            secret-key: ${{ secrets.AIKIDO_SECRET_KEY }}
            fail-on-timeout: false
```

Now the action will still shut down after 2 minutes, but it won't fail and block your pipeline. You can combine this behaviour with other marketplace integrations to get notified when the action times out. For example, you can send a slack notification, but only when the Aikido action timed out:

```yaml
name: My Github action
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '*'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Detect new vulnerabilities
        uses: AikidoSec/github-actions-workflow@v1.0.4
        id: aikido_vulnerabilities
        with:
            secret-key: ${{ secrets.AIKIDO_SECRET_KEY }}
            fail-on-timeout: false
    
      - name: Send Slack message in case Aikido scanner timed out
        uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.23.0
        if: steps.aikido_vulnerabilities.outputs.outcome === 'TIMED_OUT'
        with:
            payload: |
            {
                "key": "value",
                "foo": "bar"
            }
        env:
            SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

## Contributing

Install the dependencies  
```bash
$ npm install
```

When the changes have been implemented, you need to build and package the code for release. Run the following commands and commit it to the repository.
```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

## Change action.yml

The action.yml defines the inputs and output of our action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Creating a new release

To update the app, you will need to update the app's bundle. First run
```shell
npm run build
```
Followed by:
```shell
npm run package
```
The contents of the dist folder should now be altered, commit these changes and merge them into the main branch.

Next, create a release on Github by clicking on `tags` and then `releases`. Then you can draft and release a new version.
